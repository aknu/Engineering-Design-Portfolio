# Engineering-Design-Portfolio
My enginering design portfolio

I am using github to save the changes along with this project if it comes for me to use another device.

The 2 programs I am using in this class are
* CADStd lite
* Google Sketchup

I may learn stuff from this class about 3d modeling and textures
